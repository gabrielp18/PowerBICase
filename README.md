# Business Problems
Considering the intense growth, there are problems that need to be solved for greater organization and generation of results. The challenge is deciding how to reorganize the team to better meet customer needs and keep pace with growth. Consider that the team's objective is to increase the number of customers on the platform and improve customer retention.

### **• What strategy should we have to grow and retain customers?**  
For the growth and continuous growth of the company, the Pareto principle can be adopted, where efforts are adopted in the portion of 20% of the customers that bring 80% of the revenue to the company. For this, we could improve the attractiveness of the product for this public, favoring benefits such as: loyalty programs, bonuses, reduction of fees, facilitation of entry into the business, commercial proposals focused on the culture of the country in focus. These strategies can be beneficial for the company's growth, in addition to improving the retention of these customers on the platform.
In any case, customer churn can be linked to a few reasons, such as: better opportunities in competitors, low returns, poor customer management, among others. What is the pain that we must heal so that he remains on the platform? What's wrong? Price, platform, delay in deliveries, slow system, bug? The answer to this question may come from the growth of the support team, improving the understanding of these customers. To provide greater customer retention some of the previously mentioned strategies can also be used.
Going deeper, churn is something dangerous for every company, so a more detailed analysis can be valid, finding out what types of customers are favorable, new or old customers, whether they have a large or small budget, among others.

### **• How many people does our team need and what is the correct allocation of these people among the different analyst positions?**  
Taking into account that in the last year the company presented a growth of 12.2% per year, and expecting a positive growth of the same this year, surpassing the past metrics, it is estimated a growth of approximately 40%, in an optimistic scenario and with a confidence limit of 95%. With this growth, it is necessary to hire at least 12 employees, with the premise that the company's growth is directly correlated with the number of employees.
For allocation, we must think about some aspects: segments that generate higher returns, segments with higher churn rates, higher average ticket and prospecting.
The first sales, atom and small segments are managed by the OB Consult team, in addition to the Recover team for atom and small. Therefore, these three segments, when added together, hold an 87% share in the total commission from clients. Therefore, at least 7 employees should be transferred to this sector. In addition, these segments account for 89% of the company's churn, therefore, of the 9 employees, at least 2 must be transferred to the Recover team, with 5 to OB Consult. The other 5 must be divided between New business and customer strategy. New business to continue generating new customers, being 1 for generating and prospecting leads and 2 for prospecting customers. And 3 for customer strategy, since the company has an accelerated growth, a more robust team is needed to design new strategies for the company's growth.

### **• Assuming that the team reorganization is approved by the area manager, how should we assess whether the restructuring has generated positive results?**  
Decrease in the churn rate and consequently the increase in the average ticket, increase in revenue, increase in new customers.

### **• What data should be tracked in this new allocation of teams?**  
% churn, commission, average ticket, number of customers.

### **• Which customers should the company focus its retention efforts on to generate more results?**  
Coincidentally, the sectors with the highest revenue for the company are the ones with the highest % of churn, therefore, focusing on this area, the decrease in churn will be linked to the increase in revenue, since these customers continued on the platform. In addition, the segments considered as Debite and Register, those prospecting clients and those new to the platform present a churn rate of 95%. Decreasing this churn can increase the retention of these new customers on the platform as well.

### **• What is the best international expansion plan? (Which possible countries should the company focus on to leverage the growth of the operation?)**  
For a good use of the business expansion, it is necessary to invest in countries that have the necessary infrastructure to support the demand. Countries with the highest number of cell phones and internet connections are favorable. As well as greater purchasing power, to keep the business running. Among the countries, the table above lists possible candidates, in descending order. It is noted that countries with higher purchasing power and higher level of development are excellent candidates. It is worth mentioning that these countries have great competition due to the free market and still suffer different regulations than our country, which can generate certain obstacles in the implementation of the application.
